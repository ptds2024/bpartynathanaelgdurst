\title{Calculate the Radius of an Ice Cream Cone (For Loop)}
\usage{
cone_radius_for(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the heights of the cone.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the radius of the cone at the specified heights.
Returns 0 for heights outside the valid range.
}
\description{
Computes the radius of an ice cream cone for a given vector of heights using a for loop.
This implementation processes each element sequentially, making it less efficient than vectorized alternatives.
}
\examples{
# Example usage
cone_radius_for(c(-1, 5, 8.5, 9.5, 12))  # Returns radii for a vector of heights
}
