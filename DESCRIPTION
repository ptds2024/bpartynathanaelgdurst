Description: 
    This package provides a collection of functions and a Shiny application for simulating
    and optimizing resource requirements for ice cream party planning. It includes 
    implementations for calculating the radius, volume, and surface area of custom 
    ice cream cones, as well as simulation tools for estimating resource needs based 
    on weather and guest attendance. Designed for teaching, experimentation, and efficient 
    simulation, it leverages Rcpp for high-performance computations and features 
    a user-friendly interface.
